#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop, maintain and optimize software systems. It involves a structured approach towards the design, coding, testing, deployment and maintenance of software systems. It emphasizes on methodologies such as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Agile Development and DevOps which ensure that the software is built systematically, all while ensuring optimal performance, security and maintanability.

Software Engineering is important in the technology industry as it forms the foundational basis upon which digital infrastructure is built upon. All of the applications and sytems that we interact with on a day to day basis are built upon the software engineering principles. High quality practices ensure the production of high quality software especially in performance-critical operations.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968 - The birth of Software Engineering during the NATO Software Engineering Conference. During the conference, the term "software engineering" was initially coined and was formally introduced to reinforce the need of applying structured engineering principles to the development of sofware applications.

1970s-1980s - During this time, structured programming redefined how software was being developed. Before this time, software was written in an unstructured manner making it very diffucult to read, debug and maintain. This led to the development high level languages such as Pascal, C and Ada.

2001-Present - The Emergence of Agile Development which represented a shift form the rigid and sequential Waterfall mehodologies of software development. Contrarily, Agile was iterative, customer centric and allowed for continuous feedback and improvements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning – Define project goals, scope, budget, and timeline to ensure feasibility.

2. Requirements Analysis – Gather and document what the software must do, based on user and business needs.

3. Design – Create system architecture, user interfaces, and database structures to plan how the software will function.

4. Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.

5. Testing – Identify and fix bugs through various testing methods to ensure software quality and performance.

6. Deployment – Release the software for users, either as a full launch or in stages.

7. Maintenance – Provide updates, fix issues, and improve functionality as needed after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology follows a structured, step-by-step approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It works best for projects with fixed requirements, minimal changes, and a need for thorough documentation. Industries like banking and healthcare use Waterfall to ensure security and compliance. For example, banking software benefits from this method as it requires strict testing and regulatory approval before deployment.

The Agile methodology is flexible and iterative, breaking projects into small sprints for continuous improvements. It allows frequent feedback and quick adaptations, making it ideal for evolving projects. Agile is popular in dynamic industries like startups and tech, where user needs change rapidly. For instance, a mobile app startup can release a basic version, gather feedback, and update features regularly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications. Works on implementing features, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance based on project requirements.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software quality by designing and executing test cases, identifying bugs, and verifying that the product meets requirements. Uses automated and manual testing to improve reliability.

Project Manager – Oversees the development process, ensuring the project stays on schedule, within budget, and meets business goals. Coordinates team efforts, manages risks, and communicates with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential for software development as they provide a unified workspace with tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers, improving efficiency and reducing errors. They help streamline coding, testing, and debugging, making development faster and more organized. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.

Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes, allowing developers to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and manage multiple code versions efficiently. They help prevent data loss and improve teamwork in software projects. Examples include Git (with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and Apache Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Identifying and resolving software issues can be time-consuming. For this challenge the solution can be using debugging tools, writing clear error logs, and implementing test-driven development (TDD) to catch bugs early.

Another challenge is that new languages, frameworks, and tools emerge frequently. For this the engineers can continuously learn through online courses, developer communities, and hands-on projects.

Large projects can also become difficult to organize and maintain. To mitigate this challenge, software engineers can follow best practices like modular programming, design patterns, and Agile methodologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - Testing individual components of a software to make sure that they are each working well on their own.  It helps catch bugs early in development.
Integration testing - Testing the integration between the components of the software. It ensures smooth data flow and interaction between components.
System testing - Testing the entire software as a whole. It evaluates the entire software application to verify that it meets specified requirements and works as a complete system.
Acceptance testing - Testing the working of the software against the user's requirements. It determines whether the software meets business needs and user expectations, often conducted by stakeholders before final deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and optimizing inputs (prompts) to  enable LLM models generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It involves structuring questions, providing context, and using specific wording so as to improve the AI output. It is important as it enhaces human-AI interaction by availing precise and useful responses to user prompts. It is particularly vital in applications such as chatbots, content generationn and coding assistance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt- How is AI helpful?
Improved Prompt - How is AI transforming the health industry, and what are some of the real world applications int the field?

The improved prompt is clear, specific and concise, which makes the LLM focus on AI in the health care industry and some of the relevvant examples instead of talking about technology in general.
